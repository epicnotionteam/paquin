        "content": "<p>In 1949, The Paquin Company was established in Wickliffe, OH as a local distributor of hydraulic parts. At that time, Cleveland, OH was thriving economically, earning the title \"best location in the nation\" and becoming an All-American City. By 1950, the cityâs population had approached one million.<\/p><p>By the turn of the century, Paquin had evolved into an advanced hydraulics service distributor, also supplying pneumatic and linear motion controls. The companyâs growing reputation expanded its customer base across Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan, West Virginia, and Kentucky.<\/p><p>In 2007, Mr. Robert Williams joined the company, bringing years of leadership experience. He implemented a strategic vision for business development and growth, modernized machinery, and increased operating capacities. His investment in highly qualified personnel enabled Paquin to design and manufacture intricate hydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical systems in-house. The company also became known for solid-state derived control solutions.<\/p><p>Paquin continued to grow, creating additional departments for the design and construction of internally produced parts. By 2012, Paquin had become a distributor with two production sectors, <a href=\"\/pages\/global-intex\" title=\"Global Intex\">Global Intex<\/a> and <a href=\"\/pages\/excel-manufacturing\" title=\"Excel Manufacturing\">Excell Manufacturing Solutions<\/a>. These divisions allowed Paquin to engineer, produce, and deliver proprietary components and integrated controls, as well as fully packaged process systems.<\/p><p>In 2021, Robert Williams became the sole owner of The Paquin Company.Â Over the next two years, Robert and his management team prepared for the next phase of Paquinâs evolution. In 2023, they announced the creation of a fourth division, <a href=\"\/pages\/paquin-sensors\" title=\"Paquin Sensors\">Paquin Sensors<\/a>, marking a significant milestone in the companyâs journey from a local hydraulics distributor to an engineering-based manufacturer of industrial control solutions.<\/p>",
